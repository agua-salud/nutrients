<p>In <a href="#a.-arbitrary-filtering">Part A</a>, we apply arbitrary filtering to the 16S rRNA and ITS data sets. In <a href="#b.-perfect-filtering">Part B</a> we use PERFect <a href="https://github.com/katiasmirn/PERFect">(PERmutation Filtering test for microbiome data)</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="smirnova2019perfect">(<a href="#ref-smirnova2019perfect" role="doc-biblioref">Smirnova, Huzurbazar, and Jafari 2019</a>)</span> to filter the data sets. And in <a href="#c.-pime-filtering">Part C</a> of this workflow, we use PIME <a href="https://github.com/microEcology/pime">(Prevalence Interval for Microbiome Evaluation)</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="roesch2020pime">(<a href="#ref-roesch2020pime" role="doc-biblioref">Roesch et al. 2020</a>)</span> to filter the FULL 16S rRNA and ITS data sets.</p>

<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

<p>We begin by summarizing the results of each filtering method on the 16S and ITS data sets. Below you can find the complete workflow for each filtering method.</p>

<p>To run PERFect, we need the ASV tables in data frame format with samples as rows and ASVs as columns. PERFect is sensitive to the order of ASVs, so here we test <strong>a</strong>) the default order in the phyloseq object and <strong>b</strong>) ASVs ordered by decreasing abundance.</p>

<p>Next we run the filtering analysis using <a href="https://rdrr.io/github/katiasmirn/PERFect/man/PERFect_sim.html"><code>PERFect_sim</code></a>. The other option is <a href="https://rdrr.io/github/katiasmirn/PERFect/man/PERFect_perm.html"><code>PERFect_perm</code></a> however I could not get <code>PERFect_perm</code> to work as of this writing. The process never finished :/</p>
<p>We need to set an initial p-value cutoff. For 16S rRNA, we use <code>0.05</code> and for ITS we use <code>0.05</code>.</p>

<p>How many ASVs were retained after filtering?</p>
<p>First the 16S rRNA data set. Default ordering resulted in <strong>58311</strong> ASVs and reordering the data resulted in <strong>19706</strong> ASVs.</p>
<p>And then the ITS data set. Default ordering resulted in <strong>33657</strong> ASVs and reordering the data resulted in <strong>12934</strong> ASVs.</p>
<p>For some reason, the package does not remove based on the p value cutoff that we set earlier (<code>0.05</code>). So we need to filter out the ASVs that have a higher p-value than the cutoff.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>[1] &quot;Total 16S rRNA ASVs with p-value less than 0.05&quot;
[1] &quot;[1] default order: ASVs before checking p value was 58311 and after was 4616&quot;
[1] &quot;[1] decreasing order: ASVs before checking p value was 19706 and after was 4615&quot;
[1] &quot;[1] --------------------------------------&quot;
[1] &quot;Total ITS ASVs with p-value less than 0.05 &quot;
[1] &quot;[1] default order: ASVs before checking p-value was 33657 and after was 1712&quot;
[1] &quot;[1] decreasing order: ASVs before checking p-value was 12934 and after was 1765&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now we can make phyloseq objects. Manual inspection of the results from <code>PERFect_sim</code> for the 16S rRNA data indicated that using the <strong>decreasing</strong> order and filtering p-values less than 0.05 yielded in the best results. Manual inspection of the results from <code>PERFect_sim</code> for the ITS data indicated that using the <strong>default</strong> order and filtering p-values less than 0.05 yielded in the best results. These approaches limited the number of ASVs found in only 1 or 2 samples. So first we filter out ASVs with p-values lower than the defined cutoff and then make the objects.</p>

<p>Using the output of <code>pime.split.by.variable</code>, we calculate the prevalence intervals with the function <code>pime.prevalence</code>. This function estimates the highest prevalence possible (no empty ASV table), calculates prevalence for taxa, starting at 5 maximum prevalence possible (no empty ASV table or dropping samples). After prevalence calculation, each prevalence interval are merged.</p>

<h3 id="calculate-best-prevalence">Calculate Best Prevalence</h3>
<p>Finally, we use the function <code>pime.best.prevalence</code> to calculate the best prevalence. The function uses randomForest to build random forests trees for samples classification and variable importance computation. It performs classifications for each prevalence interval returned by <code>pime.prevalence</code>. Variable importance is calculated, returning the Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA), Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI), overall and by sample group, and taxonomy for each ASV. PIME keeps the top 30 variables with highest MDA each prevalence level.</p>

<h3 id="estimate-error-in-prediction">Estimate Error in Prediction</h3>
<p>Using the function <code>pime.error.prediction</code> we can estimate the error in prediction. For each prevalence interval, this function randomizes the samples labels into arbitrary groupings using <code>n</code> random permutations, defined by the <code>bootstrap</code> value. For each, randomized and prevalence filtered, data set the OOB error rate is calculated to estimate whether the original differences in groups of samples occur by chance. Results are in a list containing a table and a box plot summarizing the results.</p>

<p>This step takes a <strong>really</strong> long time to run. The code is included below in case you would like to perform this analysis.</p>

<p>It is also possible to estimate the variation of OOB error for each prevalence interval filtering. This is done by running the random forests classification for <code>n</code> times, determined by the <code>bootstrap</code> value. The function will return a box plot figure and a table for each classification error.</p>

<h3 id="calculate-best-prevalence-1">Calculate Best Prevalence</h3>
<p>Finally, we use the function <code>pime.best.prevalence</code> to calculate the best prevalence. The function uses randomForest to build random forests trees for samples classification and variable importance computation. It performs classifications for each prevalence interval returned by <code>pime.prevalence</code>. Variable importance is calculated, returning the Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA), Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI), overall and by sample group, and taxonomy for each ASV. PIME keeps the top 30 variables with highest MDA each prevalence level.</p>

<h3 id="estimate-error-in-prediction-1">Estimate Error in Prediction</h3>
<p>Using the function <code>pime.error.prediction</code> we can estimate the error in prediction. For each prevalence interval, this function randomizes the samples labels into arbitrary groupings using <code>n</code> random permutations, defined by the <code>bootstrap</code> value. For each, randomized and prevalence filtered, data set the OOB error rate is calculated to estimate whether the original differences in groups of samples occur by chance. Results are in a list containing a table and a box plot summarizing the results.</p>

<p>This step takes a <strong>really</strong> long time to run. The code is included below in case you would like to perform this analysis.</p>

<p>It is also possible to estimate the variation of OOB error for each prevalence interval filtering. This is done by running the random forests classification for <code>n</code> times, determined by the <code>bootstrap</code> value.
